# What is Jwc?

Jwc is a JavaScript framework for using JSX to write web components on the web. It builds on the [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) standard and provides a simple function-based API for writing components.

::: warning
JWC is currently in `alpha`. The API is not stable and may change at any time.
:::

The goal of JWC is to provide a simple, lightweight, and performant way to write web components. It is not a full framework like React or Vue. It is not a library like LitElement or Stencil. It is a framework for writing web components.

## Why Jwc?

Jwc supports the following features:

- Function-based API
- JSX
- TypeScript
- Web Components

If you are looking for a way to build web components, Jwc is a great choice. You just need some basic knowledge of JavaScript and JSX. You don't need to learn a new templating language.

## Why Web Components?

Web Components are a set of standards that allow you to write custom HTML elements. They are a native browser feature that is supported by all modern browsers. They are the future of the web.

Web Components are a great way to write reusable components. They are a standard that is not tied to any framework. They can be used in any framework or without a framework at all.
