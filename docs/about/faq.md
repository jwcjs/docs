# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Web Components?

Web Components is a set of standards that allow developers to create reusable and modular components for web applications. These components are self-contained and can be used in any HTML page, regardless of the framework or library being used.

Web Components are built using four main technologies:

- **Custom Elements**: This allows developers to define new HTML elements with custom behavior and properties.

- **Shadow DOM**: This is a way to encapsulate the internal structure and styling of a web component, so that it is isolated from the rest of the page.

- **HTML Templates**: This allows developers to define HTML templates that can be used to create reusable markup.

- **ES Modules**: This is a way to define and import JavaScript modules, which can be used to create reusable code that can be shared between web components.

Web Components are designed to be interoperable, meaning they can be used with any framework or library. They can also be easily shared and reused across different projects, making it easier for developers to build and maintain web applications.

## Differences between WC and other frameworks?

Web Components are a set of standards for creating reusable and modular components for the web, while frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular are JavaScript libraries that provide a set of tools and features for building web applications.

One key difference between Web Components and frameworks is that Web Components are designed to be **framework-agnostic**, meaning they can be used with any framework or library. They are also designed to be standalone and self-contained, so they can be easily **shared and reused across different projects**.

On the other hand, frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular provide a complete set of tools and features for building web applications, including a programming model, a set of libraries, and a rendering engine. These frameworks are typically used to build complex and interactive single-page applications, and they often come with their own set of conventions and best practices for building applications.

Another key difference is that Web Components are built using native web standards, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular often use their own programming models and abstractions. This means that Web Components are more closely tied to the underlying web platform, while frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular provide a more abstracted and opinionated way of building applications.

::: tip Overall
Web Components and frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular can be used together to build web applications, and they can also be used separately depending on the needs of the project. Web Components can be a useful tool for building reusable and modular components that can be shared across different projects and frameworks, while frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular can be used to build more complex and interactive single-page applications.

## What features does Jwc provide?

Jwc is a JavaScript framework for using JSX to write web components on the web. It builds on the Web Components standard and provides a simple function-based API for writing components.

The goal of Jwc is to provide a simple, lightweight, and performant way to write web components. It is not a full framework like React or Vue.
